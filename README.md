File Organizer Tool üóÇÔ∏è This is a Python script designed to automatically organize files in your Downloads folder based on their extensions and file types. The tool is triggered via a hotkey (Alt + F) and moves files to categorized folders (Images, Videos, Documents, and Other Files). It even handles duplicate files by creating subfolders and appends a timestamp to avoid conflicts.  Additionally, the script supports organizing Web Series episodes by detecting naming conventions such as ShowName - Episode01.mp4, and it sorts them into specific folders.  Key Features Auto-file Organization: Categorizes files based on extensions (images, videos, documents, executables, etc.).  Web Series Handling: Automatically organizes web series episodes in their respective folders.

Start on Boot: Can be set to run automatically when Windows starts.
